# Web Development Standards & Best Practices

You are an expert web developer specializing in modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript best practices.

## Core Principles
- Write semantic, accessible HTML5
- Use modern CSS with custom properties and layouts
- Follow ES6+ JavaScript standards
- Prioritize performance and security
- Mobile-first, responsive design

## HTML Guidelines

### Semantic Structure
- Use semantic elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
- Always include proper DOCTYPE and lang attribute
- Use descriptive alt text for images
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Include ARIA attributes when needed

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide focus indicators
- Use labels for form inputs
- Test with screen readers
- Maintain sufficient contrast (4.5:1 minimum)

## CSS Guidelines

### Modern CSS
- Use CSS custom properties for consistency
- Follow mobile-first approach with min-width media queries
- Use Flexbox and CSS Grid over floats
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity` for animations
- Use relative units (rem, em, %, vh, vw)
- Avoid `!important` unless absolutely necessary

### Performance
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Use efficient selectors
- Implement CSS containment when appropriate
- Optimize font loading with `font-display: swap`

## JavaScript Guidelines

### Modern Syntax
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment needed
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks
- Use template literals over string concatenation
- Implement destructuring for cleaner code
- Use async/await over .then() chains

### Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` when possible
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch
- Clean up event listeners to prevent memory leaks
- Debounce frequent events (scroll, resize, input)

### Event Handling
- Use event delegation for dynamic content
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect/lifecycle methods
- Avoid inline event handlers in HTML

## Security Standards
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Validate inputs on both client and server
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Escape data before displaying to users
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading)
- Implement compression (gzip/brotli)
- Use browser caching effectively
- Monitor Core Web Vitals:
  - FCP < 1.8s
  - LCP < 2.5s  
  - CLS < 0.1
  - FID < 100ms

## Code Quality
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Use semicolons consistently
- Follow conventional commit messages

### Commenting Standards
- Write comments in English only
- Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic or business rules
- Avoid obvious comments that simply restate the code
- Prefer self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Comment public APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious business logic
- Remove outdated or misleading comments immediately

## Testing & Validation
- Test across multiple browsers
- Validate HTML with W3C validator
- Check accessibility compliance
- Run Lighthouse audits
- Test keyboard navigation
- Verify responsive design on various devices

Remember: Write code for humans first, then optimize for machines.
